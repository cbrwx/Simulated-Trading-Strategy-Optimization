# Simulated-Trading-Strategy-Optimization
This Python script demonstrates a simple simulation-based approach to optimize a trading strategy's entry points using random price variations. The script uses numpy for random number generation.

## How It Works

The code simulates different entry points for a long and short trading position and calculates the probabilities of price increases and decreases for each scenario. It then identifies the best combination of entry points that maximizes the total probability of price increases.

- The script begins with the definition of the original trading parameters such as long and short entry prices, take-profit (tp) and stop-loss (sl) percentages, and the number of simulations.

- The percentage variation around the original entry prices is defined using the variation_percentage.

- Random entry prices are generated within the specified variation range for both long and short positions.

- The script iterates through each set of randomly generated entry prices and simulates trading for both long and short positions using the simulate_trade function. The probabilities of price increase and decrease for each position are calculated.

- The script keeps track of the best probability pair that maximizes the total probability of price increases.

- After iterating through all variations, the script prints out the results for each variation and finally displays the best probability pair.

## Usage

- Adjust the original trading parameters such as long_entry, short_entry, tp_pct, sl_pct, and num_simulations according to your strategy.

- Define the desired percentage variation around the original entry values using variation_percentage.

- Run the script. It will simulate trading for different entry variations and output the probabilities of price increases and decreases for both long and short positions.

- The script will also display the best probability pair that maximizes the total probability of price increases for both long and short positions.

- Analyze the results to identify the most favorable entry points for your trading strategy.
